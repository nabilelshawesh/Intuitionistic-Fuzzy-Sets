## 📘 Bachelor's Thesis Overview

This project is based on my bachelor's thesis, which explores the
methods and tools for evaluating entrepreneurial tendencies and
capabilities, with particular emphasis on the GET2 (General Measure of
Enterprising Tendency) psychometric tool.

The study analyzes the five fundamental factors that determine
entrepreneurial tendency:

-   Need for Achievement
-   Need for Autonomy
-   Creativity
-   Internal Locus of Control
-   Calculated Risk-Taking Propensity

Additionally, the research examines the Repertory Grid technique as a
qualitative method for assessing entrepreneurial characteristics.

A critical analysis of these methodologies is conducted, focusing on:

-   Their limitations
-   Their reliability
-   Their ability to identify and develop entrepreneurial capacity

The findings suggest that entrepreneurial characteristics:

-   Can be effectively assessed using structured tools
-   Can be cultivated through targeted education and practical training

This evaluation is particularly valuable for educational institutions,
businesses, and organizations seeking to enhance their entrepreneurial
potential in response to modern labor market demands and 21st-century
challenges.
